    <h4><strong>Q: I just changed some tokens in my build. Why is the Virtual TD interface still using the old values?</strong></h4>
    <h5>A: The server remembers each character's Virtual TD state for several hours in case you get temporarily disconnected. Click Settings > Reset Character to forget the current state and start a fresh one based on your updated build. (Then you'll need to re-enter the Adventure Passcode, roller ID, etc.)</h5>

    <h4><strong>Q: How do I use Benrow's?</strong></h4>
    <h5>A: Equip your FoB weapons in the melee slots (not ranged). In the Virtual TD interface, underneath Attack Melee, click "Flurry Throw" and then use the melee attack die (not ranged).</h5>

    <h4><strong>Q: How do I use abilities that let me cast more than one spell in the same round?</strong></h4>
    <h5>A: Click the first spell you want to use. In the last dialog screen, select Add to Cast Sequence, then click Cast Spell (or Cast Without Mark if appropriate). Repeat this process for the second spell. When the DM calls for attack rolls, click Execute Casting Sequence (located in the Sequence area after 3rd level spells) to send the total damage.</h5>

    <h4><strong>Q: How do I use Spell Surge?</strong></h4>
    <h5>A: First click Spell Surge and Cast Spell, then click the actual spell you want to cast and Cast Spell. Note that the actual spell may be added to a Cast Sequence if you like, but do not try to add the Spell Surge itself to a Cast Sequence.</h5>
